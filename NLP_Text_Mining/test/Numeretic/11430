He produced works in the fields of philosophy, mathematics, logic, political science and music. In the Islamic world, he attained to a high level of fame and prestige in the field of philosophy, one that is comparable to that of Aristo’s, and is named as the “second teacher” in the aftermath of Aristo, the “first teacher”. Farabi is known in the West as “Alpharabius”.
