Our goal is to organize weekly seminars and to get closely acquainted with recent topics and progress related to arithmetic, and to learn them. In time, we plan to work on analytic number theory, algebraic number theory, harmonic analysis, sieve methods, zeta functions and rational points on curves. Participation of the students and from outside are important for us. Also, our objective is to organize workshops (Arithmetica Izmir) that last one or two days in each semester. In the seminars and workshops, we aim the emergence of new questions and to bring together the people who are interested in these questions.', 'Arithmetica Izmir, 16 November 2018', 'Arithmetic Winter School', 'Arithmetica Izmir 2, 10 May 2019', 'Arithmetic Home', 'Arithmetic Seminars', 'Arithmetica Izmir', 'Material Archive', 'Recent Seminars', 'Pure Injective Modules and Finite Representation Type', 'Meltem GÜLLÜSAÇ, Dokuz Eylül University.Date:6th of March, 2020, Friday, Time: 10.30 – 12.00.Place: Dokuz Eylül Univ., Tınaztepe Campus, Faculty of Science, Department of Mathematics, Classroom ', '…', 'Unit Fractions', 'Haydar Göral,Dokuz Eylül University.Date:28/02/2020, Friday, Time: 10:30.Place:Dokuz Eylül Univ., Tınaztepe Campus, Faculty of Science, Department of Mathematics, Classroom B256.Abstract:In this talk, we will talk on ', '…', 'Hales-Jewett Theorem', 'Sedef Taşkın (DEU) Date and Time: 21/02/2020, 10:30 Place: B256 Abstract:In this talk, we introduce the Hales-Jewett Theorem and its density version.
