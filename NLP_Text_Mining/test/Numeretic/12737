Module applications based on small group work are done in the first three years. Our students set their topics according to their preference among the study titles opened by the academic members. The first year SSMs are usually about reviewing thier data collection studies, while others are in the form of research. Student groups are gathered periodically under the supervision of the responsible academic member to discuss and share information about the process.', 'The products that appeared in the SSMs are exhibited as posters and presentations at the SSM Symposium held at the beginning of the year. Numerous research papers have also been translated into international publications.', '© Dokuz Eylül Üniversitesi - Tıp Fakültesi -Dokuz Eylül Üniversitesi Sağlık Yerleşkesi / İnciraltı 35340-İZMİR']
