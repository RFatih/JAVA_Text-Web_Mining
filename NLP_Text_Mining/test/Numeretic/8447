The Financial support will not be reclaimed, moreover, the purpose of this support is not to cover all expenses of the student but to help him/her in additional expenses caused only by the mobility. Chosen students can be “Erasmus students receiving no grants” (with “0” grants), if they want.', 'Erasmus+ Mobility for Study is done within the scope of interinstitutional agreements. Institutions announce their students for applications to specify outgoing Erasmus students within the frame of their existing agreements. The mobility activity can only be done between institutions with ECHE which have a bilateral agreement. In order to benefit from the Mobility for Study, students have to apply for the Erasmus Coordinatorships of their own institutions and to be involved in the electoral process. Every institution states its own application and election dates.', 'The European Union Education and Youth Programmes Centre designates the annual national priorities and the necessary criteria for Erasmus students who will be chosen before the mobility period starts. Higher education institutions select their students according to the criteria determined by the Presidency of European Union Education and Youth Programmes Centre.', 'Students can benefit from more than one mobility provided that they don’t exceed the 12 months limit for each term of Bachelor’s, Master’s and Doctorate Degree. Receiving Mobility for Placement grant doesn’t prevent taking Mobility for Studies grant.', 'For student selection conditions and grant amounts please check the relevant academic year’s Erasmus+ Programme National Call.', 'Academic Standing, Course Registration and Tuition Fees', 'The courses, which the student has to take at the higher education institution in Turkey, are equally designated in the institution he/she will go and the recognition of these courses is recorded and secured with a Learning Agreement that is signed between the student, the sending institution and the host institution before the exchange period. It can’t be expected that the course names and contents are exactly the same, the high resemblance of course contents is enough. The recognition of courses stated in a Learning Agreement, whose required signatures of both the institution authorities and the outgoing student are completed, is contracted during the application of the higher education institution for ECHE. In case of violation, the Centre is responsible for reporting the situation to the European Commission and this can result in the cancellation of the institution’s Charter.', 'During the course selection, 30 ECTS credits for 1 semester and 60 ECTS credits for 1 year are to be aimed. The objective success is when the student collects 2/3 of the credits of the courses he/she takes. When successful students are back in Turkey, the semesters they spent abroad will be regarded as if they spent them in Turkey. Unsuccessful students will continue from where they had left before they became an Erasmus student, however, they are exempt from courses equivalent to the credits of the courses they were successful in total.', 'Erasmus students enroll to their own University in Turkey, freezing their registration for the semester they will spend abroad is out of question. Registration and tuition fees are paid to their own institution to which they are enrolled, no registration or tuition fee is paid to the host institution. However, the host institution can claim small amount of payments from Erasmus students except of the registration and tuition fee they demand from their own students. Membership fee to sports facilities or transportation fee are examples for this kind of payments.', 'ERASMUS+ OUTGOING STUDENT CHECKLIST', 'WHAT SHOULD I DO TO BECOME AN STUDY MOBILITY ERASMUS STUDENT?', 'APPLICATION PROCESS', 'ERASMUS+ STUDENT MOBILITY OUTGOING STUDENT FLOW CHART', 'Learning Aggrement for Studies', 'Guideline for Learning Agreement', 'Confirmation of Stay', 'ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED BY COUNTRIES', 'Grants is valid for the 2019-2020 academic year', 'Group Countries', '', '', 'Host Countries', 'Monthly Grant (€)**', '1. and 2.
