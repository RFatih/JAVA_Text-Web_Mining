Imagination in three dimensions and ability of creativity are very important where cultural/local/vernacular values should also be considered in the proposed design. Due to the reality of impossibility to design without the synthesis of universal, global, national and local values, the education programs of our departments are being formed according to the principles of the institutes like UIA, AESOP and our local and cultural characteristics. In addition to that, our departments are in direct co-operation with other national departments due to the adaptation processes of BOLOGNA criteria.The education given in our faculty aims not only to graduate well educated architects or city planners, but also to educate honest professionals who have adopted Atatürk’s principles and secularity and also who are sensitive to social problems, paying more respect to the benefits of the society than their own interests.', 'Important Links', 'Student Web Registration', ' Faculty by the Numbers', ' Alumni', ' Web Site Editors ', ' Site Map', 'Contact', 'Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Architecture  Tinaztepe Campus, Doğuş Caddesi No:207/K, Pk:35390 Buca-İZMİR', 'Tel :+90.232.453 50 89 - 453 75 08', 'Faks : +90.232.453 29 86', 'E-Posta :mimarlık@deu.edu.tr', '© Dokuz Eylül Üniversitesi Mimarlık Fakültesi', '                    Kapat                ', 'Font Boyutunu Değiştir', 'A-', 'A+', 'Fontu Sıfırla', 'Font Değiştir', 'Kontrast', 'Renk Seçiniz', 'black', 'white', 'green', 'blue', 'red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'navi', 'Linklerin Altını Çiz', 'Linkleri Belirginleştir', 'Tümünü Sıfırla', 'Işıkları Kapat', '        Close sidebar    ']
