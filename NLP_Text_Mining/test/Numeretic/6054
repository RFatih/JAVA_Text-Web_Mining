The other one is to encourage undergraduate math majors to pursue a career in Mathematics.', 'In the morning sessions, four colloquium talks will be given by the invited speakers to introduce their research of interests. The afternoon sessions are devoted to graduate students and young researchers. All students are welcome to apply. There will also be an informative panel of faculty members describing the graduate program at DEU followed by Q&A session.', 'All abstracts must be submitted in English. The talk can be either English or Turkish but this must be clearly stated in the submission process.', 'Invited Speakers', 'Yusuf Civan( Süleyman Demirel University )', 'Title: A short tour in combinatorics', 'Abstract:This is an invitatory talk to a short trip through the jungle of combinatorics, one of the fascinating fields of modern mathematics. If time permits, we plan to visit various sites in the jungle, including those from combinatorial number theory to discrete geometry, graph theory to combinatorial commutative algebra, etc. Lastly, after showing our respect to the founder king “Paul Erdös” of the jungle, we review the current status of some of his favorite open problems.', 'Konstantinos Kalimeris( University of Cambridge )', 'Title: Water waves – Two asymptotic approaches', 'Abstract:TBA', 'Müge Kanuni Er ( Düzce University )', 'Title: Mad Vet…', 'Abstract:How does a recreational problem “Mad Vet” links to interesting and interdisciplinary mathematical research “Leavitt path algebras” in algebra and “Graph C*-algebras”in analysis.', 'We will give a survey of the last 15 years of research done in a particular example of non-commutative rings flourishing from the fact that free modules over some non-commutative rings can have two bases with different cardinality.  Surprisingly enough not only non-commutative ring theorists, but also C*-algebraists gather together to advance the work done. The interplaybetween the topics stimulate interest and many proof techniques and tools are used from symbolic dynamics, ergodic theory, homology, K-theory and functional analysis. Many papershave been published on this structure, so called Leavitt path algebras, which is constructed on a directed graph.', 'Haydar Göral( Dokuz Eylül University )', 'Title: Arithmetic Progressions', 'Abstract:A sequence whose consecutive terms have the same difference is called an arithmetic progression. For example, even integers form an infinite arithmetic progression. An arithmetic progression can also be finite. For instance, 5, 9, 13, 17 is an arithmetic progression of length 4. Finding long arithmetic progressions in certain subsets of integers is at the centre of mathematics in the last century. In his seminal work, Szemerédi (1975) proved that if A is a subset of positive integers with positive upper density, then A contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. With this result, Szemerédi proved the long standing conjecture of Erdős and Turan. Another recent remarkable result was obtained by Green and Tao in 2005: The set of prime numbers contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. In this talk, we will survey these results and some ideas behind them.', 'Categories ', 'workshop', 'Post navigation', 'On Isoartinian and Isonoetherian Modules – 2', '2019-2020 Fall Term Applications for Graduate Study', 'Mail adress: Dokuz Eylül Üniversitesi Tınaztepe Yerleşkesi, FenFakültesi Matematik Bölümü 35390 Buca/İzmir', 'e-mail: matematik.fen@deu.edu.tr  Phone: +90 232 301 85 08  Fax: +90 232 453 41 88', '© 2021 Dokuz Eylül University Faculty of Science Department of Mathematics', ' • Powered by ', 'GeneratePress', 'Scroll back to top']
