The number of institutions in question increase every year. They require qualified personnel for management, exhibition, storage, recording, classification, definition, conservation and identification of legal obligations. Besides the archaeological excavations and similar research areas, this field is a specialised field that can be defined shortly as collecting, conserving, classifying, exhibiting and designating the cultural relations.', 'In addition to the possibility of pursuing an academic career, students who graduate from the department of museum studies, will have the ability and knowledge to found museums, establish new museum departments, run educational programs, design and exhibit. Virtual museum applications which have become widespread with the advancement of especially private museums, will provide new areas of work for the graduates and contribute to the museum studies of the country. With the establishment of the museum studies program, the specialised workmen force in the field of museology in Turkey which until today has tried to be covered only by the graduates of the departments of archaeology and history of art, will be in its required nature. The graduates will make a difference in the planning and realisation of the future museums.', 'English', 'Türkçe', 'Announcements', 'Duyuru Bulunamadı!', 'Calendar', 'June 2021', 'M', 'T', 'W', 'T', 'F', 'S', 'S', '« May', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', '23', '24', '25', '26', '27', '28', '29', '30']
